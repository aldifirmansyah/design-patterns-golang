Object Pool design pattern is not on the Design Patterns book (by Grady Booch).
The Object Pool design pattern is creational pattern in which a pool of objects is initialized and created beforehand and kept in a pool. As and when needed, a client can request an object from the pool, use it, and return it to the pool. The object in the pool is never destroyed.
