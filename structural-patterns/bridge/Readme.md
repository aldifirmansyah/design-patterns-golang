- Abstraction (computer.go): Defines the abstraction's interface.; Maintains a reference to an object of type Implementor.
- RefinedAbstraction (win.go, mac.go): Extends the interface defined by Abstraction.
- Implementor (printer.go): Defines the interface for implementation classes. This interface fact the two correspond exactly to Abstraction's interface; in fact the two interfaces can be quite different. Typically the Implementor interface provides only primitive operations, and Abstraction defines higher-level operations based on these primitives.
- ConcreteImplementor (epson.go, hp.go): Implements the Implementor interface and defines its concrete implementation.
